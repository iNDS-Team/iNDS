# iNDS

## ⚠️ BIG IMPORTANT NOTE ⚠️

**This repository is largely unmaintained.** [I](https://github.com/FrederickGeek8)
archived this repository sometime in 2021. One of the problems with open-source
is that many people will post Issues about your application, but few will
actually contribute to the project. My goal with creating
[iNDS-Team](https://github.com/iNDS-Team) was to foster community support and
maintaince of this project, but few actually contributed anything. Currently,
`inds.nerd.net` has not been revived, although I still own that domain. Ideally,
I would not need to pay for hosting costs of that website since, especially if
it becomes popular again, I would not want to scale a small server up for heavy
traffic. If no one is paying me, then I cannot pay the bills for that server.
I'm **hoping** that there is a way to host the repository on Github Pages, and
have the download links, as well as the Cydia repo `deb` files, go to the files
on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/iNDS-Team/iNDS/releases), although I
do not know if that is possible. **If you want to contribute to getting
`inds.nerd.net` up and running again, please submit a Pull Request to this repo.**

The other day I discovered that the [linux Github repo](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
has "Issues" disabled, although you _should not_ be posting pull requests there.
I thought that was a neat idea for this repository, at least in the short term,
so that I would not need to be spammed with Issues without actually being paid
or having time to maintain and work on this project full-time.

One of the things I was concerned about when archiving this repository is the
chance that some nefarious actor could distribute a malicious version and there
would be little recourse or action I could take. It will be hard for me to
prevent this, but archiving a repository on Github does not help with the lack
of communication with the community.

If you are interested in contributing to this project and joining the team, you
can read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), although even that hasn't
been updated in ages. The best way to get through is to open a pull request.
I will still review pull requests, though it will be on my own (limited) time,
at least until some other people can help pick up the slack with this project.

### (Perhaps) Good Alternatives

**I do not endorse this usage of these applications, nor am I responsible for any potential side-effects.**

It seems like the [Delta](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta) emulator by [Riley Testut](https://github.com/rileytestut) is a good alternative. They are also known for the creation of [AltStore](https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore) which could potentially be supported in the future for this application (if you submit a Pull Request yourself!).

## Description

**Supports iOS 9.0 and up.**

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/iNDS-Team/iNDS.svg)](https://github.com/iNDS-Team/iNDS/releases/latest)

[iNDS (dead link, see above)](https://inds.nerd.net) is a derivation of the previous Nintendo DS apps
for iOS, nds4ios and [Nitrogen](https://github.com/NitrogenEmulator). The iNDS
Team release of iNDS is a fork of the original [iNDS emulator by William Cobb](https://github.com/WilliamLCobb/iNDS). iNDS Team aims to create
a version that is driven by support from the community, adding trusted contributors
to the team over time, so that pull requests and issues do not sit untouched.

Currently, emulation is powered by the [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org/) threaded ARM interpreter and runs at nearly full speed on the iPhone 5 and above. Due to the need to mmap the entire ROM into memory, older devices with only 256MB of RAM are not supported. These devices include the iPod touch 4, iPad 1, iPhone 3GS, and anything below those devices.
